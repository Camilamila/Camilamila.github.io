description: Analysis projects about procurement data as part of my work at OCP
---


At OCP I lead the data use support to partners, developing methodologies on how to use open contracting data and advising on how to improve data quality to achieve specific goals, reforms, research, monitoring, and advocacy. In addition, I perform internal data analysis to better track and measure the progress and impact of key OCP interventions and demonstrate the usefulness of procurement datasets to local users and local objectives.
