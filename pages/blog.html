From 2011 to 2018 I worked as a data and investigative reporter in Costa Rica, and as an open data trainer and consultant in Latin America and other regions.  As part of the data journalism team in La Naci√≥n, we were two-time finalists in the Data Journalism Awards, an international award recognizing outstanding work in the field of data journalism worldwide.
